# Fluxabled Fork of the Deforum Stable Diffusion Extension for Forge

Experimental fork of the [Deforum extension](https://github.com/deforum-art/sd-forge-deforum)
for [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge), 
fix'd up to work with Flux.1 and integrate Parseq keyframe redistribution logic.

## Current status

This fork of the extension is _basically working_.

&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; Configurations that use the **experimental render core** by enabling the 
new keyframe distribution feature, may require that some unsupported features are being kept disabled.


## Requirements

### Get SD WebUI Forge
Install, update and run the 'one-click installation package' of
[Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge
as described. Includes:
* Python 3.10.6
* CUDA 12.1
* Pytorch 2.3.1

Other versions _may_ work with this extension, but have not been properly tested.

### Run Flux on Forge

Get `flux1-dev-bnb-nf4-v2.safetensors` from huggingface and put it into your `<forge_install_dir>/models/Stable-diffusion/Flux`:
https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/flux1-dev-bnb-nf4/blob/main/flux1-dev-bnb-nf4-v2.safetensors

Get the following 3 files from huggingface and put them into `<forge_install_dir>/models/VAE`
* `ae.safetensors` https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell/tree/main
* `clip_l.safetensors` https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/tree/main
* `t5xxl_fp16.safetensors` https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/tree/main

Restart Forge, set mode to "flux", select the flux checkpoint and all the 3 VAEs in "VAE / Text Encoder" and test with Txt2Img.

## Installation

### Directly in Forge (recommended)

Go to tab "Extensions" - "Install from URL" and use this: https://github.com/Tok/sd-forge-deforum.git

### From the commandline

Open commandline and run `<forge_install_dir>/venv/Scripts/activate.bat` 
to activate the virtual environment (venv) for Python used by Forge.

With the venv from Forge activated, do:
```
cd <forge_install_dir>/extensions
git clone https://github.com/Tok/sd-forge-deforum
cd sd-forge-deforum
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Update Deforum Settings

Get the latest default-settings.txt and place it directly into your 'webui' directory, then click "Load All Settings":
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tok/sd-forge-deforum/main/scripts/default_settings.txt
Rename it to `deforum_settings.txt` (or whatever matches the name of your settings file in the UI) and put it directly into your 'webui' directory.

&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; Some Settings are currently not properly loaded or are not persisted 
in `default_settings.txt` and may need to be set manually the first time:
* Tab "Prompts" - "Prompts negative" not resetting
  * Consider removing the defaults because they're not used with Flux.

Recommendation: **Use ForgeUIs "Settings" - "Defaults" to save your settings.**

## Default Bunny Testrun

After installation, you can test the setup by generating the default bunny with
"Distribution" set to "Keyframes Only" and "Animation Mode" set to "3D".
This also downloads the MiDaS model for depth warping when ran for the first time
and demonstrates prompt synchronization in a no-cadence setup.

The default bunnies contain 333 frames at 720p, but only 19 of them are actually diffused.
The diffused frames are placed in the clip according to the keyframes defined in the prompts.
The prompts themselves are aligned to be synchronized at 60 FPS with the beat of an 
amen break you can find linked in the settings (enable sound):

If you used other versions of the Deforum plugin before, it may also be necessary
to update or adjust your Deforum settings. The latest example settings with for the default bunny can also be downloaded here:

## What should work, what doesn't and what's untested

### Should work:
#### Keyframe Distribution
Causes the rendering to run on an experimental core that can rearrange keyframes,
which makes it possible to set up fast generations with less jitter at high or no cadence.

##### New sub-tab under "Keyframes"
* Can now be used **with- or without- Parseq**.
* Allows for precise sync at high cadence.
* Detailed info and recommendations on new tab.

#### Asynchronous Subtitle generation
All subtitles are now generated and written to an .srt file in advance.
Complex subtitle generations should work fine with Parseq but are currently limited with Deforum-only setups.
* New Deforum setting for skipping the prompt-part to a new line in .srt files.
* New Deforum setting for choosing simple (non-technical) subtitles that contain only the text from the prompt.
  * Complex subtitles should work fine when Parseq is used, but are otherwise limited to essential information only.
  * Recommendation: turn on for now if not using Parseq
* Removed emtpy "--neg" param from being written into the subtitles
  because negative prompts are ignored in Flux workflows.
* Improved padding of technical information so subtitles jitter less.

### Perhaps working (untested)
* Flux schnell
  * There's not a lot of precision for fine-tuning strength values when only 4 steps are required.
* Control Net
* Hybrid Video
* Non-Flux workflows

### Currently not working with experimental core
* Kohya HR Fix
  * may need to be left disabled
* FreeU
  * may need to be left disabled

### Other Stuff
* Includes a new default setup to generate default bunny at 60 FPS in 720p with keyframes only.
* Non-essential emojis can be turned off with a checkbox under "Settings" - "Deforum".
* Seed and Subseed tabs unified.

## Troubleshooting

### Settings file
During active development, content and structure of the `deforum_settings.txt` file 
can change quickly been updated. Settings from older versions may not behave as expected.
